# Time Series Analysis 
Forecasting rainfall in India

## Brief Summary
Floods and droughts are becoming all the more common in India with every passing year. They are responsible for causing destruction to property, loss of lives and most importantly, the high farmer suicide rates. It is thus of utmost importance to be better prepared against these and that requires a knowledge of the expected amount of rainfall in the relevant time period. Being a resident of India and having experienced this destruction first-hand was my primary motivation behind choosing this topic.

## Data
The data was acquired from the open source data portal of India. This data set contains monthly rainfall data of 36 meteorological subdivisions of India from 1901-2015. Rainfall is measured in mm. For this project, the state of Kerala was considered for analysis.
